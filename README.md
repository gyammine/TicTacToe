I thought about whether a user should be able to play alone versus "the computer" but that would always result in the user losing or reaching a draw so I'm assuming there will always be 2 users playing. On top of that time would be very tight.

Will not be allowing users to edit their player name, text input and form handling out of scope in my opinion.

An onboarding flow isn't within scope here so i'll create a quick link to the game rules.

Difficult to add animations anywhere near alotted time unless a package is used, so the UX will be basic.

The UI could scale to screen size with the import of a standard helper (I hope that isn't a problem)
